**[Combs IR, Studivan MS, Voss JD (2020) Quantifying impacts of stony coral tissue loss disease on corals in Southeast Florida with surveys and 3D photogrammetry]**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since 2014 stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) has contributed to substantial declines of reef-building corals in Florida. The emergence of this disease, with its ability to impact numerous coral species, has generated a need for both widespread reef monitoring and the implementation of novel survey and disease mitigation techniques. This study paired SCTLD prevalence assessment with colony-level monitoring to help improve understanding of disease dynamics on both individual coral colonies and reef-wide scales. Surveys were conducted throughout the northern Florida Reef Tract to monitor the presence or absence of disease, disease prevalence, and the coral species affected by SCTLD. Observed SCTLD prevalence was lower in Palm Beach County than in Broward or Martin County, but there were no significant changes in prevalence over time. To assess colony level impacts of the disease, we optimized a low-cost, rapid 3D photogrammetry technique in order to fate-track infected Montastraea cavernosa coral colonies over four time points spanning over three months. Total colony area and healthy tissue area on fate-tracked colonies decreased significantly over time, but disease lesion area was not correlated with total colony size. These results suggest that SCTLD affects colonies regardless of size, therefore larger colonies should be prioritized for colony-level intervention efforts to maximize success. Traditional coral surveys combined with 3D photogrammetry can provide greater insights into the spatial/temporal dynamics and impacts of coral diseases on individual colonies and coral communities than surveys or visual estimates of disease progression alone.
